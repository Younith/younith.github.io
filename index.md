# Introduction

This documentation serves as a structured record of my work and progress.

The goal is not to rewrite textbooks or vendor documentation, but to **capture what I’ve actually done**: configurations, labs, design decisions, mistakes, and the reasoning behind fixes.

These notes are written to be:
- **Practical** – focused on real configurations and outcomes  
- **Concise** – no filler, only what matters  

This documentation also acts as a **long-term reference**.  Keeping everything in one place makes it easier to revisit earlier decisions and avoid relearning the same lessons the hard way.
